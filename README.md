##### About

Theoretical linguistics aims at developing models of linguistic knowledge. The
course is an introduction to the field from a computational perspective. The
course does not include topics pertaining to the processing and
acquisition of language, fields that make essential use of probability and
statistical learning. The course also differs widely from Natural
Language Processing, an engineering discipline that aims at developing
language technologies with human-level performance. Finally, we will
have only a cursory discussion of semantics, deferring a more detailed look to
the sequel [COGS 543](https://github.com/umutozge/computational-semantics).

The course would suit you in the following cases:

* I am a CogSci student, and either,
    - I need a course to fulfil my language track requirement, or,
    - I am interested in doing language-related research.
* I am not a CogSci student, I have some linguistics background, but I never used a computer to build
    and try out my analyses.

##### Prerequisites

You **must** attend the first session to be eligible to take this course.

##### Grading

* Assignments
* Quizzes
* Final exam

Percentages are decided on the basis of the difficulty of the particular item. There will be bonuses to make up for missed quizzes and bad days.

##### Policies

Late submission: The only excuse for a late submission is a medical report for **at least three days** within the week of the assignment.
