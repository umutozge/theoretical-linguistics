* W054: The scenario about having a pill and sleeping and dying should be ignored, it's rather misguided.
* W058: The example "John grows tomatoes/John's growth of tomatoes" should be changed to "John produces tomatoes/John's production of tomatoes".
* V064: The first Agremment formulation should have "that have no maximal projection nodes" changed to "that have no maximal projection nodes (other than DP)".
