##### About

Theoretical linguistics aims at developing models of linguistic knowledge. The
course is an introduction to the field from a computational perspective. The
course does not offer an introduction to topics pertaining to the processing and
acquisition of language, fields that make essential use of probability and
statistical learning. The area of the course also differs widely from Natural
Language Processing, which is an engineering discipline that aims at developing
language technologies with human-level performance. Finally, the course will
have only a cursory discussion of semantics, to be taken up in more detail in
the sequel [COGS 543](https://github.com/umutozge/computational-semantics).

The course would suit you in the following cases:

* I am a CogSci student and,
    - I would like to have an introductory course that will
    fulfil my language track requirement;
    - I am interested in doing language-related research.
* I am not a CogSci student, I have some linguistics background, but I never used a computer to build
    and try out my analyses.

##### Prerequisites

You **must** attend the first session to be eligible to take this course.
