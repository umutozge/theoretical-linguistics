##### About

Theoretical linguistics aims at developing models of linguistic knowledge. In
this course we will study computational models of morphology and syntax,
interfaced to a basic semantics.[^1]

[^1]: For more detailed semantic modelling check [COGS 543](https://github.com/umutozge/computational-semantics).

##### Prerequisites

You **must** attend the first session to be eligible to take this course --
this is necessary but not sufficient. The course brings together linguistics
and computation, if you have not taken a course in neither field, this
course might be too difficult as a first course. COGS students who took 501 and
502 (and preferably an introductory linguistics course) should do fine.
