Assignment
----------

The assignment is due before class time.

* Extend the basic lexicon to capture the sentences in Steedman's (2019) example
    (11). Your solution does not have to be sound for this exercise, all you
    need is to be able to derive these sentences as `S`. Each succesful sentence
    will earn you **3pts**. As bonus each correct semantics will earn you **2pts**.
    Here are the semantics. As you see, you can, for now, treat `a` exactly like
    `the` in the syntax.

    - `promise'(persuade'(leave'alice')alice'harry')sally'harry'`
    - `seems'(promise'(leave'harry')sally'harry')`
    - `wants'(try'(begin'(write'(a'play')harry')harry')harry')harry'`

    Note: don't worry if your derivation delivers:

    - `wants'(try'(begin'(write'(a'(\x.play'x))harry')harry')harry')harry'`

    for the third sentence, the two versions are equivalent.
