COGS 532 - Week 13 :calendar: 21/5 - Spring 2024
-----------------------------------------------

Assignment (due :calendar: 21/5)
----------

[**20pts**]

You are required to extend the previous lexcion to include:

* definite article `the`
* nouns `spy` `doctor` 
* relative pronouns `who` and `whom`
* sentential complementizer `that`
* sentential complement verb `think` (non-fin) and `thought` (fin)

You are free to build over the sample solution we published for the previous
assignment.

Here are some tips and hints:

* Have `\x\p. p (lex' y (x y))` as the semantics of `the`. On the syntactic side
  `the` will be a function from `n` to whatever you would like to have for `harry`.
* Have `\p\q\x.p x & q x` for the semantics of your relative pronouns.
* Have `\x.lex' x` or `lex'` for your `n`, it doesn't matter which.
* It would be better to first try examples simple than the ones on the test set,
  and incrementally build your lexicon.


Here is the behaviour expected from your lexicon:


Input:

```
the spy promised harry to try to persuade the doctor to watch vertigo
the doctor thought that harry persuaded sally to watch the spy 
harry tried to think that sally watched vertigo
harry thought sally watched vertigo
harry watched the doctor who left
the spy whom sally thought that harry watched left
the spy who sally thought that harry watched left
the spy who persuaded sally to watch harry left
the spy whom persuaded sally to watch harry left
```
