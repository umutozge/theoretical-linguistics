Assignment
----------

[**6pts**] Define a lexicon in `lexc` format that includes only two roots:
`believe` and `generous`. You are required to capture the patterns of forms
where these words interact with the prefix `un-` and the suffixes `-able` and
`-ity`. Here are some examples that would help you both understand the
requirements of the assignment and set your encoding at the upper and lower
level. Note that it is enough that you end up with an abstract representation
like `believe^able^ity` rather than the ultimate surface form `believability`.


1.  ```
    believe+V
    believe
    ```
1.  ```
    believe+V+Abl
    believe^able
    ```
1.  ```
    Neg+believe+V+Abl
    un^believe^able
    ```
1.  ```
    Neg+believe+V
    ???
    ```
1.  ```
    believe+V+Abl+Ity
    believe^able^ity
    ```
1.  ```
    Neg+believe+V+Abl+Ity
    un^believe^able^ity
    ```
1.  ```
    believe+V+Ity
    ???
    ```


Submit your `lexc` file naming it `a04-<your-surnmae>.lexc`, which must be loadable
to `foma` without errors.
