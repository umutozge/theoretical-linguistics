[**15pts**]

The basic lexicon in `SmallWorld` cannot handle transitive verbs like `likes`.
Modify the basic lexicon so that you can handle:

`john likes mary`

`john likes every spy`

`*john like mary`

`no spy likes john`

`*no spy like john`


Your grammar must work for all the determiners in the basic lexicon.
