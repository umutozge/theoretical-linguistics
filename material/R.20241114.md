---------------------------------------

Reading
-------
* [Michaelson](http://lfcs.ii.metu.edu.tr/port/michaelson-intro-funcprog-with-lambda.pdf) S. 2.4-2.9 (inclusive). 
* Optionally start reading [$\lambda$-calculus notes](http://lfcs.ii.metu.edu.tr/port/lambda-calculus.pdf), if the above is not sufficiently clear.


Checklist
---------
* Make sure you understand the calculations in Michaelson. 
* There are a number of lambda evaluators on the web like [this](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rmk35/lambda_calculus/lambda_calculus.html), or [this](https://lambdacalc.io/), etc. It would be useful to try the examples in Michaelson on one of these tools. You can experiment with your own reductions as well.
