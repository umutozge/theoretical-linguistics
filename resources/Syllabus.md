#### About

Theoretical linguistics aims at developing models of linguistic knowledge. In
this course we will study computational models of morphology and syntax,
interfaced to a basic semantics.[^1] 

#### Prerequisites

You **must** attend the first session to be eligible to take this course --
this is necessary but not sufficient. The course brings together linguistics
and computation, if you have not taken a course in neither field, this
course might be too difficult as a first course. COGS students who took 501 and
502 (and preferably an introductory linguistics course) should do fine.

#### Grading

Assignments (mostly) in `foma` and `smallworld`. We will take best 80% (rounded down) of your assignments into account.

#### Policies

Late submission: The only excuse for a late submission is a medical report for at least three days within the week of the assignment.  

Attendance: 3 misses has no cost, for each further miss you lose one letter.
