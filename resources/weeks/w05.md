Assignment
----------

[**6pts**] Listed below are the citation and accusative marked forms of some
nouns:

```
kitap   kitab^ı
çap     çap^ı
kap     kab^ı
kaş     kaş^ı
kat     kat^ı
tat     tad^ı
araba   araba^yı
```

First, define a lexicon in `lexc` format that turns the deep forms to an
intermediate form as in the previous assignment. You are required to have the
same representation for the accusative case at this intermediate level.

Second, define another machine (or machines) that would turn your intermediate
forms to another intermediate form, where the final consonant changes and `y`
insertion (or deletion, whichever way you go) are handled. The final level you
obtained would look like as given above.

Submit your `lexc`,  `xfst` files.
