Reading

*  Adger Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.3


Checklist
---------
* The feature checking system employed by Adger builds trees that need to be inspected for features left unchecked to decide on grammaticality: You build the tree, when the derivation is over, you go and see if there are any `uX` left down the tree. Can you think of an alternative in which when the derivation is over, you are able to tell whether the input was grammatical only by looking at the features at the topmost node (aka. root)?
