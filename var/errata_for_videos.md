### Errata for COGS 532 videos

* V054: The scenario about having a pill and sleeping and dying should be ignored, it's rather misguided.
* V058: The example "John grows tomatoes/John's growth of tomatoes" should be changed to "John produces tomatoes/John's production of tomatoes".
* V064: In the tentative Agreement formulation we require that no maximal projection exists that includes one of the nodes while excluding the other. Here we exclude DPs as intervening maximal projections; the maximal projections we mean here are FinP and VP. This definition is a tentative one devised for pedagogical purposes anyway.
