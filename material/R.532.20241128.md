Reading
-------

* Same as last week: [Steedman (2019)](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/steedman/papers/ccg/moravcsik2.pdf), up to Section 4 (exclusive).

Checklist
---------
* Now, derivations should look more tractable. 
* Try to derive these examples by defining the syntax and semantics of the lexical items occurring in them:
    - `John shut the door : shut'(the'door')john'`
    - `John didn't shut the door : not'(shut'(the'door')john')` 
    - `Harry thought John sleeps : thought'(sleeps'john')harry'`
