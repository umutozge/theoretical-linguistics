Quiz  (17/10) - COGS 501/Fall 2024
------------------------------------
1. **[3pts]**
    Briefly explain the difference between the concepts **proposition**,
    **sentence**, and **utterance**

   -----------
    **Solution:**

    A proposition is an abstract object that can be true or false when matched
    against a state of affairs. The proposition `The snow is white` is true in our world. A sentence is another abstract object that is a name of a proposition in some particular language. For instance, the English sentence _The snow is white_ and _Der Schnee ist weiÃŸ_ are two sentences that name the proposition `The snow is white`. An utterance is a concrete object that constitutes the use of a sentence by an agent at a particular time and place.

    1. The sentence uttered may be perfectly well-formed on all counts, yet
       cannot convey the intended meaning:
       `Harry wants Tony to shave himself.` where the intended reading is that
       Harry wants Tony to shave Harry.
