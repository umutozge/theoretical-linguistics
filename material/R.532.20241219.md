Assignment
----------

The assignment is due before class time.

* The examples are same as the last week. This time you are asked to make a more sound lexicon. Use the `bar` feature to distinguish between infinitival VPs like `to walk`, `to promise harry to walk`, etc., and finite VPs like `walks`, `promised Harry to walk`, etc. You must not accept strings like `*john to go`.

* You also need to take care of agreement errors, `*john sleep` must be ruled out. 

    The inifinitival bit gets **2pts**, agreement bit gets another **2pts**.
