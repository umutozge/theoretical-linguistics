COGS 532 - :calendar: 26/12 - Fall 2024
---------------------------------------

Assignment
----------

This weeks assignment is quite short. It is an opportunity for those who need to
catch up with the rest. Those who are already fine can go on playing with CCG.

The assignment is due before class time.

* **[2pts]** The solution posted for the assignment of last week has a deficiency: It
    cannot handle sentences like `john wants to try to write a play`. Discover
    its source and correct it.
