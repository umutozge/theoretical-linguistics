Assignment
----------

[**6pts**] Listed below are the citation and accusative marked forms of some
nouns:

```
kitap   kitabı
çap     çapı
kap     kabı
kaş     kaşı
kat     katı
tat     tadı
araba   arabayı
```

First, define a lexicon in `lexc` format that turns the deep forms to an
intermediate form as in the previous assignment. You are required to have the
same representation for the accusative case at this intermediate level.

Second, define another machine (or machines) that would turn your intermediate
forms to another intermediate form, where consonant changes and `y`
insertion (or deletion, whichever way you go) are handled.

Submit both your `lexc`,  `xfst` files.
