Assignment
----------

[**6pts**] Define a lexicon in `lexc` format that includes only two roots:
`believe` and `generous`. You are required to capture the patterns of forms
where these words interact with the suffixes `-able` and
`-ity`. Here is how your machine is required to behave.

`down`:

```
believe+V
believe

believe+V+A
believe^able

believe+V+A+N
believe^able^ity

believe+V+N+A
???

believe+V+N
???

generous+A
generous

generous+A+N
generous^ity

generous+A+A
???
```

`up`:

```
believe
believe+V

believe^able
believe+V+A

believe^able^ity
believe+V+A+N

believe^ity^able
???

believe^ity
???

generous
generous+A

generous^ity
generous+A+N

generous^able
???

```

Note that it is enough to have an intermediate representation
like `believe^able^ity` rather than the ultimate surface form `believability`.

### Tips for testing

An efficient way to test your machines is to put all your test expressions in a
file, and `up` or `down` the entire file with a single command. For instance, save the 
following to a filen named `up-test.txt`:
```
believe
believe^able
believe^able^ity
believe^ity^able
believe^ity
generous
generous^ity
generous^able
```

Then, start `foma` from within the
same directory, and, assuming your `lexc` file is named `my.lexc`, do the
following:

```
read lexc my.lexc
up < up-test.txt
```

You can likewise form a file for `down` testing named `down-test.txt`, and
replace `up` with `down` in the above command. Here is what must be in your `down`
test file:

```
believe+V
believe+V+A
believe+V+A+N
believe+V+N+A
believe+V+N
generous+A
generous+A+N
generous+A+A
```

Note that by ⬆️ /⬇️  or `Ctrl-P`/`Ctrl-N`  you can go through previous commands in `foma` to
save some typing.

Submit your `lexc` file naming it `a04-<your-surnmae>.lexc`, which must be loadable
to `foma` without errors. We will use the above test cases to test your solution.
