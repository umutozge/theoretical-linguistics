Reading
-------

* Same as last week: [Steedman (2019)](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/steedman/papers/ccg/moravcsik2.pdf), up to Section 4 (exclusive).

Checklist
---------
* Now, derivations should look more tractable. 
* Try to derive these examples by defining the syntax and semantics of the lexical items occurring in them:
    - `John shut the door : shut'john'the'(door')`
    - `John didn't shut the door : not'(shut'john'the'(door'))` 
    - `Harry thought John sleeps : thought'(sleeps'john')harry'`
