Assignment (due :calendar: 2/4)
----------


[**20pts**] 

You are now asked to develop the given model by adding some verbal inflections.
The data you need to capture is:

```
uyu (imperative)
uyur (present)
uyudu (past)
uyurdu (pres copula past)
uyurmuş (pres copula perfective)
uyuyor (progressive)
uyumuş (perfective)
uyuyormuş (progressive copula perfective )
uyuyordu (progressive copula past)
uyumuştu (perfectıve copula past)
uyumuşmuş (perfectıve copula perfective)
uyuduydu (past copula past)
```

Your grammar should not generate any ungrammatical variants. You can use the
following analytical symbols:

```
+Past +Pres +Perf +Cop +V +3pSg
```

All the examples are in 3rd person singular. If you like you can extend your
model to other agreement categories, but you don't have to.


------
For those who do not want to work on Turkish data, here is an alternative
assignment. To be eligible for this assignment Turkish must NOT be your native
language.

The task is to model the following pattern:

```
big, bigger, biggest
cool, cooler, coolest, coolly
late, later, latest, lately
happy, happier, happiest, happily
unhappy, unhappier, unhappiest, unhappily
red, redder, reddest
real, unreal, really
clear, clearer, clearest, clearly, unclear, unclearly
```

Be careful about words that cannot take the opposite prefix `un-`. 
You should be as general as possible. For instance the rule addressing the
doubling of the `g` in `bigger` should not be `big`-specific, if possible.


You can use the analysis tags:

```
+Adj +Adv +AdjComp +AdjSup +Opp
```
